1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
   -- RDBMS refers to Relational Database Management System, which is the application that manages the database. while SQL refers to Structured Query Language, which is the most common language used to communicate with a database through queries.

1. Why do tables need a `primary key`?
   -- This is to allow each table to store and access data uniquely through an id.

1. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
   -- A Foreign Key

1. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
   -- An additional table which references the primary keys through its foreign keys.
